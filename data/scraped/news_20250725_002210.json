Hapless tourists in Paris are being charged as much as 50 per cent more than French customers, the city’s leading newspaper found. After tourists complained online about being overcharged, Le Parisien sent out a bona fide Parisian to a cafe on the Champ-de-Mars near the Eiffel Tower. It also dressed up one of its reporters as a typical tourist, sporting a T-shirt emblazoned with the tower, trainers, dark glasses and a baseball cap, and speaking in a passable American accent – albeit with a French twang.

In addition, higher transport inflation was offset by lower inflation in accommodation.\nMAS and MTI said imported inflation is expected to stay moderate, as global crude ",
