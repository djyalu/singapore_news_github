        "content": "Full-service carriers are increasingly defending short-haul leisure and Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) markets with competitive pricing. Farouk Kamal, deputy chief executive of AirAsia Aviation Group, said at a recent panel discussion that budget travellers have found Singapore becoming expensive, with airport fees and charges sometimes higher than the base fare itself. Jetstar Asia’s closure certainly thus highlights the rising pressure on airlines to critically evaluate market performance and redeploy limited resources to higher-yielding opportunities. She warns, however, that if budget carriers find themselves unable to maintain profitability in Singapore’s competitive landscape, further rationalisation or capacity shifts are possible. In a constrained supply environment, airlines are increasingly prioritising markets where they can achieve better margins and scale. “I would say most of them will generate a small profit this year.”",
